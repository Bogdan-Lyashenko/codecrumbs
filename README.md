## What
> **Have you ever got lost in a big or unknown codebase?** This tool will help you to solve that. Also, it will increase your development speed and give more knowledge about your application architecture. 
>
>**How it works?** You run `codecrumbs` command for a codebase, it analyzes source code and builds its visual representation. Write down a codecrumb-comment and codebase state will be reflected by visual client in browser on the fly.

## Demo
Check out the example of [**standalone version running here**](https://codecrumbs.io/).
 
<img src="/docs/main-ui.png" width="100%"/>
 
## Get started
### Install and run
>Pre-condition: update/install `NodeJS` version to be >= *8.11.1*  
 
1) Install ```codecrumbs``` globally (```yarn global add codecrumbs```)
2) Run ```codecrumbs -d project-src-dir -e project-src-dir/index.js```. Change parameters to match your project:```-d``` is *directory with source code*, ```-e``` is *entry point file* .
3) Go to [http://localhost:2018](http://localhost:2018/#) in the browser to check it out.

### CLI
Parameter | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
```-e```, ```--entry``` | Path to project source entry point file | ```-e src/app.js```
```-d```, ```--dir``` | Path to project source code directory | ```-d src```
```-p```, ```--port``` | Port for Codecrumbs client (optional, default *2018*) | ```-p 2019```
```-n```, ```--projectName``` | Project name alias (optional, default same as ```-d``` value) | ```-n my-hello-world```
```-f```, ```--parserFallback``` | AST parser fallback, applicable only for JavaScript project, use it when @babel-parse fails (optional, default *false*) | ```-f true```

## Features
### Breadcrumbs and trails

<img src="/docs/cc-ui.png" width="750"/>

UI explained:
1) Enable "Codecrumbs" to have codecrumbs tree on the scheme (drop-down contains extra configuration)
2) Choose "current" codecrumbs flow to display (can be either trail or all other "simple" codecrumbs)
3) Codecrumb details
4) Folder is in "active only" state, you can expand to show all children

**How to get there?** Leave breadcrumb in code by writing down a comment: ```//cc:[parameters;]```.

```cc``` (stands for "CodeCrumb") is a prefix which used by the parser; check example of parameters in the table below:  
 
Example | Description | Use case
--- | --- | ---
```//cc:remember place``` | simple breadcrumb, ```remember place``` is a title of our first breadcrumb | Mark an important place to not forget where it was
```//cc:here is bug;well, seems like a bug in logic``` | simple breadcrumb, ```well, seems like a bug in logic``` is details for breadcrumb, separated by ```;``` | Add extra information, will be rendered in popups
```//cc:signin#3;enable route``` | trail of breadcrumbs,```signin``` is the **trail ID**, ```#3``` is order **number of step**, ```enable route``` is a title describing the step. | A sequence of codecrumbs, use to describe some data flow (e.g. user login, or form submit, etc.).
```//cc:signin#1;firebase sign in;+2;do call to firebase with credentials``` | trail of breadcrumbs,```+2``` is number of lines to highlight, separated by ```;``` | Use number of lines to highlight the code related to breadcrumb 

> Note: current version supports single line comments only. 

### Multi-codebase integration
You might be interested to study connections between several codebases (sub-modules), codecrumbs supports that.
Simply start codecrumbs multiple times (once for each codebase), it all **will be synced in one picture** inside the browser tab. To control a diagram UI - select it by clicking on it :)

E.g. for server-client application, go to the source directory for your server code and run `codecrumbs -e your-server-src/index.py -d your-server-src`, same for client `codecrumbs -e src-client/index.js -d src-client`. 
> **Note:** codebases can be located wherever you want (**no** need to have them like mono-repo, etc.), simply run `codecrumbs` for directory you need.  

<img src="/docs/multi-l-c.png" width="100%"/>

### Multi-language support
Current version supports next programming languages: 
- `JavaScript`
- `TypeScript`
- `Python`
- `PHP`
- `Java`
- `C++`
- and others which use `//` as a comment :)

Please file an issue to support other language you would like to have.

### Download & Upload (learn and‚Ääshare your knowledge)

You can take a snapshot of application state at any point of time and share it with others. Simply download the json file of codecrumbs store (*top-right corner, "setup -> download"*). This json file can be then uploaded to codecrumbs (*top-right corner, "setup -> upload"*) to represent exactly same picture, even without having that project locally!

<img src="/docs/upload-feature-2.gif" width="100%"/>

### Dependencies
> Note: In current version only JavaScript offers this feature 

<img src="/docs/dep-ui.png" width="100%"/>

UI explained:

1) Enable "Dependencies"
2) Select connection between modules
3) All involved files (two or more) will be opened in "Sidebar", so you can see ‚Äúwhat is imported‚Äù and ‚Äúits implementation‚Äù.

### Flowchart
> Note: In current version only JavaScript offers this feature 

<img src="/docs/flow-ui.png" width="100%"/>

[js2flowchart](https://github.com/Bogdan-Lyashenko/js-code-to-svg-flowchart) is used in the sidebar to draw flowchart for the selected file code.

## Case studies
The tool (codecrumbs) allows us to learn, document and explain a codebase much faster. Also, with *Download & Upload* feature it becomes super easy to collect and share your "investigation results".

The ultimate goal is to have many case studies hosting at [https://codecrumbs.io](https://codecrumbs.io/). **The library of projects "explained with codecrumbs", the place for collaborative learning**. More features around that coming soon, stay tuned. 

## Support

## WIP
Next features are developing:
- **eject codecrumbs** - ability to remove all "breadcrumbs" from source code in "one click"
- **data transferring between cc trail steps** 
- **VS Code extension** - some neat features right inside the code editor. Checkout [the repo here](https://github.com/Bogdan-Lyashenko/vs-code-codecrumbs).
